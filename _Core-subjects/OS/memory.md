## virtual memory

virtual memory is that it provides the illusion to the programmer that a process whose size is larger then the size of main memory can also be execute. 

## How virtual memory work?

So basically we divide the process in sub pages and all the pages are stored in logial address space(means secondary storage) and when a process start execution then we fetch only those page into main memory which is required.
