## What's the main purpose of an OS? What are the different types of OS?

The main purpose of an OS is to execute user programs and make it easier for users to understand and interact with computers as well as run applications. It is specially designed to ensure that the computer system performs better by managing all computational activities. It also manages computer memory, processes, and operation of all hardware and software.

Types of OS:

1. Batched OS (Example: Payroll System, Transactions Process, etc.)
2. Multi-Programmed OS (Example: Windows O/S, UNIX O/S, etc.)
3. Timesharing OS (Example: Multics, etc.)
4. Distributed OS (LOCUS, etc.)
5. Real-Time OS (PSOS, VRTX, etc.)


## Benefits of multiprocessor operating system

As we know that in multiprocessor OS there is more than CPU's (in terms of CPU core's) are avaliable so at the same time we can exuecte multiple program. One also gets a considerable increase in throughput and is cost-effective also as all processors share the same resources.


## What is a bootstrap program in OS?

It is generally a program that initializes OS during startup i.e., first code that is executed whenever computer system startups. OS is loaded through a bootstrapping process or program commonly known as booting. Overall OS only depends on the bootstrap program to perform and work correctly. It is fully stored in boot blocks at a fixed location on the disk. It also locates the kernel and loads it into the main memory after which the program starts its execution.
